# SC23 ProxyStore Analysis

Data, analysis, and figures for the SC23 ProxyStore paper.

## Get Started

```bash
$ virtualenv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ jupyter-lab
```

## Overview

Each experiment is in its own Jupyter Notebook.
Notebooks are prefixed by a number to organize them in logical order
(i.e., the order in which they appear in the paper).

The data used by the notebooks (logs, CSVs, etc.) is placed in the `data/`
directory and figures should be output to `figures/`.
